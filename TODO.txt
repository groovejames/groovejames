WISHLIST:
- preserve selection when loading more
- "load all" button
- dj channels
- mp3 player: add seek forward/backward
- persist current downloads list so that it survives restarts


LATER:
- last.fm scrobbling, download recommendations

- do something against geoblocking (e.g. http://music.163.com/song?id=26393771 has no download location)
  Maybe use random chinese proxies like Fildo.net, see:
    https://github.com/SergioZgz/Fildo/blob/master/Fildo.Core.Services/NetEaseService.cs (this.AvailableProxy) and
    https://github.com/SergioZgz/Fildo/blob/master/Fildo.Core/NetEase.cs (method FixUrl)

- NetEase account?!? http://reg.163.com/reg/reg.jsp?product=music
