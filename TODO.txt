- "load all" link
- "loading" spinning wheel should be translucent over original panel (StackPane instead of CardPane?!?)
- dj channels
- sometimes bails out with "NoHttpResponseException: music.163.com:80 failed to respond", in Unirest.post/get().asObject(), set HttpRequestRetryHandler?!?
- find out why sometimes the same image is loaded twice (or use Guava Cache for image cache)

- mp3 player: add seek forward/backward
- persist current downloads list so that it survives restarts
- use Retrofit (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) instead of Unirest?!?
