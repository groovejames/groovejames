BUGS:
-

WISHLIST:
- dj channels
- mp3 player: add seek forward/backward
- persist current downloads list so that it survives restarts

LATER:
- use api from https://musicafe.co ?!?
    provides uniform API for NetEase, Xiami, QQ, but has same restrictions regarding geoblocking (ie. you need a chinese proxy for some tracks)
    part of source: https://github.com/LIU9293/musicAPI

- do something against geoblocking (e.g. http://music.163.com/song?id=26393771 has no download location)
  Maybe use random chinese proxies like Fildo.net, see:
    https://github.com/SergioZgz/Fildo/blob/master/Fildo.Core.Services/NetEaseService.cs (this.AvailableProxy) and
    https://github.com/SergioZgz/Fildo/blob/master/Fildo.Core/NetEase.cs (method FixUrl)

- NetEase account?!? http://reg.163.com/reg/reg.jsp?product=music

- preserve selection when loading more
- "load all" button
