- do something against geoblocking (e.g. http://music.163.com/song?id=26393771 has no download location)
- "load all" button
- preserve selection when loading more

LATER:
- dj channels
- mp3 player: add seek forward/backward
- persist current downloads list so that it survives restarts
- use Retrofit (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) instead of Unirest?!?
