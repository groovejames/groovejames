- "load all" link
- preserve selection when loading more
- dj channels
- find out why sometimes the same image is loaded twice (or use Guava Cache for image cache)
- play with lower bitrate, download with highest bitrate

LATER:
- mp3 player: add seek forward/backward
- persist current downloads list so that it survives restarts
- use Retrofit (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) instead of Unirest?!?
